# React + TypeScript Frontend Project.

This react app uses RAWG API to fetch games from and display them on the website.

It uses:
- Chakra UI (for design elements and Color Mode Switching).
- React Hook Form + Zod Resolver.
- Axios for API calls.

#To run:
"npm run dev"

#To Build:
"npm run build"

#NOTE!
Replace your API from RAWG with API in /src/services/app-client.ts. Otherwise, it won't be able to fetch data.
